This workspace is a full stack NIMCET preparation platform with a gamified experience. The frontend uses React (Vite), and the backend uses Node.js/Express with MongoDB. Features include user authentication, gamified levels, daily challenges, YouTube video integration, test/analysis, notes, and XP/progress system. Prioritize modular, scalable, and modern code.
